*** Warning - 1 issue(s) with the composition input resulting in removal of 1 nuclide(s) with a total of 3.92143e-06 atoms/barn-cm.
*** Mixture 3 density updated to 9.99883 grams/cc

*** If the default behavior is not acceptable, the above edits can be used to fix the composition input by removing or redistributing the atomic density of the missing nuclide(s).

*** This message can be suppressed by setting the environment variable MISSING_NUCLIDE_MSG_LEVEL=QUIET

*** The calculation will continue with the nuclide(s) removed, which will produce identical radiation transport and very similar activation/depletion results as using a cross section of 0.0 for each of the missing nuclide(s).
